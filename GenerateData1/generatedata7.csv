414.2,"Subject: Medical Report Findings  Dear [Patient Name],  I am writing to inform you of the findings of your recent medical examination. As your cardiologist, I have been able to identify a number of concerning issues and have made recommendations for ongoing care.  Firstly, it was noted that you have been prescribed Indural as a medication. Indural belongs to a class of drugs known as beta-blockers and is used to treat high blood pressure and chest pains. It is important to continue to take this medication as prescribed by your doctor.  Additionally, during the examination, it was identified that you have an occluded garage in the coronary artery. This refers to a blockage in one of the blood vessels that supply the heart muscle. This blockage can increase your risk of a heart attack or stroke. We will need to monitor this issue closely and discuss treatment options moving forward.  Further tests revealed that you have a PDA (patent ductus arteriosus) and a heart murmur. The PDA is a small opening between two blood vessels that should close after birth, but in some cases remains open. The heart murmur is an abnormal sound caused by turbulent blood flow. Again, we will monitor these issues and discuss treatment options if necessary.  In terms of medication, you are also taking Metoprolol and Naproxyn. Metoprolol is used to treat high blood pressure and to prevent angina (chest pain) while Naproxyn is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to reduce pain and inflammation. Please ensure that you continue to take these as prescribed by your doctor.  Finally, you have completed a course of Nelfinavir, which is an antiviral medication used to treat HIV. It is important to continue to take this medication as prescribed by your doctor.  Overall, the examination revealed disordered heart function and a medical history of a recent MI (myocardial infarction). It is my recommendation that you continue to receive ongoing care and monitoring to manage these issues.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions or concerns.  Sincerely,  [Your Name], Cardiologist"
