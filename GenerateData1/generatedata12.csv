Based on the tests and examinations conducted, the following observations were made:  - You are suffering from Rheumatic heart disease: This is a condition where the heart's valves become damaged due to an infection caused by bacteria. The damage causes the valve to leak blood, leading to Regurgitation. In your case, it affects the Mitral and Aortic valve. - Your Aortic regurgitation is causing Aortic Insufficiency: This means that the aortic valve is not closing properly, allowing blood to flow back into the left ventricle. - As a consequence of the above conditions, you are experiencing Congestive Heart failure: This happens when your heart is unable to pump blood effectively, leading to fluid accumulation in your lungs, abdomen, and lower limbs. - You have completed your gastrointestinal (GI) system investigation as per earlier recommendations. No major GI concerns identified. - You have mild to moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation (MR/TR): This describes the amount of backflow of blood through the mitral and tricuspid valves respectively. - There is evidence of Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP): This means that your mitral valve bulges backward into the left atrium during systole.  - You have mild to moderate degenerative joint disease (DJD) of the Mitral and Tricuspid valves: This condition is where the cartilage wears down, causing bone rubbing against bone resulting in discomfort and pain in joints. - There is evidence of Mild to moderate Tricuspid Regurgitation: This describes the amount of backflow of blood through the tricuspid valve. - You have mild to moderate osteoarthritis: This condition is caused by the wear and tear of the cartilage between the bones, causing them to rub against each other. - You have mild to moderate Arthritis: This is a condition that causes inflammation of the joints causing pain, stiffness, and swelling. - There is evidence of Mitral Valve Replacement (MVR): Replacement of a damaged mitral valve with an artificial valve. - You need Aortic Valve Replacement (AVR): Replacement of a damaged Aortic Valve with an artificial valve.  To conclude, you have multiple cardiac conditions that require ongoing management, including medication, lifestyle changes, and possible surgical intervention.
