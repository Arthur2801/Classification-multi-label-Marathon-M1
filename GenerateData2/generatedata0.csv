An echocardiogram revealed decreased contractility of the myocardial muscles located in the inferoapical and inferoposterior regions, indicating a subendocardial myocardial infarction (STEMI).  The patient was subsequently taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which revealed a critical stenosis in the right coronary artery, which was successfully treated with stent placement. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring of his vital signs and neurological status.  Throughout his hospitalization, the patient received various medications, including dual antiplatelet therapy, a beta-blocker, statin, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) to optimize his cardiac function and reduce the risk of future cardiac events. He also received additional treatment and consultation from the orthopedic team for his pre-existing OA and degenerative joint disease (DJD).  The patientâs hospital course was complicated by a transient episode of mild hypotension, which responded well to fluid resuscitation, and he remained stable afterward. A repeat echocardiogram confirmed improved myocardial contractility in the affected regions, and on the fifth day of his hospitalization, he was cleared for discharge to home with a scheduled follow-up with his outpatient cardiologist.  Overall, his completed MI was successfully treated, and he has been advised to make lifestyle modifications, including regular exercise, a healthy diet, and management of any co-existing medical conditions. We have provided the patient with educational resources on medication compliance, signs and symptoms of worsening cardiac function, and the importance of follow-up appointments with his healthcare providers.  In conclusion, John Doe presented with an inferoposterior wall MI and received prompt care that included PCI, medical management, and consultation with other specialists as needed. The patient will require close observation and treatment by his outpatient cardiac provider to monitor his condition and promote optimal cardiac health."

History of present illness: Mr. Doe is a known hypertensive and hyperlipidemic patient with a medical history of osteoarthritis, particularly OA inferoposterior temporomandibular, and completed MI (myocardial infarction) four years ago. The patient reported that the pain this time was similar to the pain he experienced with his previous MI. The patient denies any recent illnesses, travel, or other significant medical issues.  Physical Examination: On examination, the patient was alert and conscious, oriented to time, place, and person. Blood pressure was 160/95 mmHg, pulse was 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. Cardiovascular examination revealed an S3 gallop, a normal S1 and S2 sound, and no murmurs. Chest examination revealed decreased breath sounds over the right lung base.  Diagnosis: Based on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and physical examination findings, Mr. John Doe was diagnosed with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), specifically an inferoposterior wall AMI. An ECG (electrocardiogram) showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, consistent with STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) inferoapical and infero walls.  Course of treatment: The patient was immediately administered 300 mg of aspirin, 80 mg of atorvastatin, and 2.5 mg of bisoprolol. Since he was diagnosed as a STEMI patient, he was taken for emergency coronary angiography. The procedure showed 95% occlusion of the left anterior descending artery and successful thrombus aspiration, with the use of a bare-metal stent to restore CTO (chronic total occlusion). The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure.  During the hospital stay, the patient was closely monitored and received regular medical care. He was discharged from our care and given clear instructions on how to manage his cardiac health, including following up with his cardiologist, and a referral to orthopaedics for his OA subendocardial condition.  Follow-up: We recommend Mr. Doe follows up with his orthopaedic provider to manage his OA inferoposterior temporomandibular subendocardial osteoarthritis condition. Additionally, the patient must follow up with his primary care physician and cardiologist. He was prescribed medications to reduce his cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and aspirin to avoid any blood clotting or thrombosis incidents.  In conclusion, the patient's diagnosis of acute myocardial infraction with an inferoposterior wall STEMI required immediate medical intervention. With timely and appropriate medical care and vascular surgery, the patient's medical condition has stabilized. However, Mr. John Doe must continue to follow up with his medical care provider and take recommended preventative measures as necessary to maintain his healthiest possible lifestyle."
