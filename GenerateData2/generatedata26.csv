398.91,"DISCHARGE SUMMARY  Patient Information:  Name: John Doe Age: 60 years old Gender: Male Diagnosis: Rheumatic heart failure (congestive)  Summary:  Mr. John Doe, a 60-year-old male patient, was admitted to the hospital with the diagnosis of rheumatic heart failure (congestive). He presented with complaints of shortness of breath, chest pain, and palpitations. His past medical history revealed that he had experienced rheumatic fever during childhood, which left him with rheumatic heart disease.   Upon admission, several investigations were carried out, including echocardiography which showed rheumatic mitral regurgitation with severe insufficiency, moderate aortic regurgitation, and congestive heart failure (CHF). Further evaluation revealed that Mr. Doe also had degenerative joint disease (DJD) and osteoarthritis.  The patient’s treatment plan was initiated with the administration of diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to manage his CHF symptoms. After a few days of hospital stay, Mr. Doe was deemed medically stable, and surgery was scheduled to correct his mitral valve regurgitation (MVR) and aortic valve regurgitation (AVR).   The mitral valve replacement (MVR) surgery and aortic valve repair (AVR) were successfully completed, and the patient showed signs of improvement in his cardiac status. The patient was also given advice on how to manage his arthritis and DJD symptoms.   In summary, Mr. Doe was diagnosed with rheumatic heart failure (congestive) due to rheumatic mitral valve regurgitation (MR) with severe insufficiency, moderate aortic regurgitation (AR), osteoarthritis, and DJD. He underwent MVR and AVR surgery, which was successfully completed. The patient was discharged with a follow-up plan for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation, physical therapy, and periodic check-ups with his cardiologist."

398.91,"Discharge Summary:  The patient was admitted with the diagnosis of Rheumatic heart failure (congestive) with associated rheumatic arthritis and mitral valve regurgitation. During their hospitalization, a thorough workup was completed, which revealed severe mitral valve regurgitation (rheumatic origin). Additionally, mild aortic regurgitation and mild aortic insufficiency were noticed. The patient also had CHF exacerbation during admission.  The patient was treated with appropriate medications such as diuretics, vasodilators, and anticoagulants for heart failure management. Rheumatic arthritis was addressed with pain control medications, and the patient was referred to a specialist for further management.  Mitral valve replacement (MVR) was considered in the management of rheumatic heart failure (congestive) with severe mitral regurgitation but was not performed due to the patient's overall medical condition. The patient also had degenerative joint disease (DJD) and degenerative osteoarthritis, which were managed with physical therapy and analgesics.  We recommended the patient's follow-up with a cardiologist to evaluate the need for mitral valve repair or replacement, and further management of rheumatic arthritis. The patient was advised to maintain a heart-healthy diet, regular exercise, follow the medication regimen, and monitor heart rate and blood pressure at home regularly.  In summary, the patient was discharged with a diagnosis of Rheumatic heart failure (congestive), rheumatoid arthritis, mitral valve regurgitation, mild aortic regurgitation, and mild aortic insufficiency. The patient was treated with appropriate medications for CHF exacerbation, and DJD and osteoarthritis were managed with physical therapy and pain medications. Follow-up was scheduled with a cardiologist for evaluation of mitral valve replacement or repair and further management of rheumatoid arthritis."
398.91,"Discharge Summary – Rheumatic Heart Failure (Congestive)  Patient Information: Name: [Patient Name] Age: [Patient Age] Gender: [Patient Gender] Date of Admission: [Admission Date] Date of Discharge: [Discharge Date]  Medical History: The patient had a history of Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) and was diagnosed with Rheumatic Heart Failure (congestive) during the hospital admission.
