427.81,"Discharge Summary:  The patient was diagnosed with sinoatrial node dysfunction, which led to a variety of symptoms including bradycardia, pauses, and tachycardia. The patient also experienced junctional bradycardia and PVCs.  During the hospital stay, the patient was closely monitored for any further episodes of brady AVB, pauses, and tachycardia. It was observed that the patient had a bradycardic number and had a requirement of pacing. Therefore, a permanent pacemaker (PPM) was implanted to regulate the heart rate appropriately.   The patient was also treated for tachycardia and SSS (sick sinus syndrome). The patient underwent strut 2min, a procedure in which a small wire is inserted into a vein and guided into the heart to measure its electrical activity. This procedure helped to identify the underlying cause of the tachybrady condition and allowed the doctors to provide appropriate treatment.  In addition, the patient has been informed about job restrictions, and it was advised to avoid strenuous physical exertion and long periods of standing.  Overall, the patient was discharged with a PPM in place and instructed to follow-up with the cardiologist regularly."

Electrocardiogram revealed Sinoatrial node dysfunction characterized by sinus pauses, bradycardia, junctional tachycardia, and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). The patient had a history of sick sinus syndrome (SSS) and had undergone pacemaker implantation two years back. However, the pacemaker was not functioning properly as evidenced by the presence of bradycardia and pauses despite adequate pacing at the programmed lower rate of 60 beats per minute (ppm). Mr. X was diagnosed with tachy-brady syndrome and underwent a device interrogation that confirmed the pacemaker malfunction. He underwent a pacemaker revision surgery with the replacement of the pacing lead and generator. Post-operatively, the patient was observed for two minutes, during which there was no evidence of pause or tachy-brady episodes. The patient's job requires him to climb stairs and lift heavy objects, but he was advised to avoid strenuous physical activity for one week. Mr. X was discharged with instructions for regular follow-up visits, and advice to report any symptoms of rapid or slow heartbeats, irregular heartbeats or palpitations, and shortness of breath. He was advised to maintain a heart-healthy lifestyle by following a low-sodium diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding smoking and alcohol. The patient was also instructed to avoid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or any high-frequency energy production environments, as these may interfere with his pacemaker's functioning. He was discharged with a strut card indicating his pacemaker type, settings, and details of his most recent device-related tests."
427.81,"Discharge Summary  The patient, who was diagnosed with sinoatrial node dysfunction, was admitted with symptoms of bradyarrhythmia, pauses and junctional bradycardia. The patient underwent an electrocardiogram (ECG) which showed sinus bradycardia with occasional pause of 2 minutes and junctional rhythm with PVCs. The patient also had a history of sick sinus syndrome (SSS) and had a dual chamber pacemaker (PPM) implanted earlier.  On admission, the patient was noted to be bradycardic with a heart rate of 40 bpm with occasional pauses. The patient also developed tachycardia with a heart rate of around 120 bpm intermittently, suggestive of tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome (TBS). The patient underwent a thorough workup including blood tests, chest x-ray, echocardiography, and other imaging studies which were unremarkable.  The patient was managed with medications including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin. However, the patient continued to experience episodes of tachy-bradyarrhythmia with sustained tachycardia requiring frequent hospitalizations. The patient was also noted to have AV block with a variable PR interval suggestive of Mobitz type 1 pattern (Wenckebach).  Given the patient's persistent symptoms despite medical therapy, the patient was referred for an electrophysiology study (EPS) where a tachycardia focus in the right atrial junctional area was identified. An ablation procedure was performed which targeted the focus leading to the resolution of the patient's symptoms.  The patient was discharged on medications with strict follow-up with the pacemaker clinic. The patient was advised to avoid strenuous activities and to report any new symptoms to the clinic promptly. The patient was also counseled regarding their job and the need to avoid tasks that may trigger tachycardia or bradycardia. The patient was given a strut card that contained their technical pacemaker information and emergency contact numbers.  In summary, the patient with sinoatrial node dysfunction and a history of sick sinus syndrome was found to have tachy-brady syndrome with junctional and ventricular arrhythmias.

427.81,"Patient Name: _________ Age: _________ Gender: _________ Date of Admission: _________ Date of Discharge: _________  Diagnosis: Sinoatrial node dysfunction  Summary:  The patient was admitted to the hospital due to complaints of dizziness, lightheadedness, and palpitations for the past few days. On evaluation, the patient was diagnosed with Sinoatrial node dysfunction.  During the hospital stay, the patient had episodes of bradycardia with pauses lasting up to 2 minutes, which were followed by tachycardia. The patient also had occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). The patient was found to have junctional bradycardia, which was the cause of the pauses in the heart rhythm.  To manage the patient's condition, a permanent pacemaker (PPM) was implanted to ensure that the patient's heart rate does not go too low during brady arrhythmias. Post-implantation, the patient showed minimal episodes of bradycardia, junctional rhythm or pauses, and no episodes of tachycardia or PVCs. Hence, the patient was deemed fit for discharge.  Follow-up care: The patient was advised to continue taking medications as prescribed, follow up with the cardiologist, and report any symptoms such as dizziness, lightheadedness, palpitations, or chest pain. Also, the patient was advised to avoid strenuous and tiring activities that may cause tachybrady arrhythmia.  Job or other related activities should not be taken until a full recovery is achieved. It is important that the patient maintains a regular follow-up with the doctor and uses the medication as prescribed. The implanted pacemaker will adjust the heart rate according to the patient's activity level, so the patient should not try to control the pacemaker using external devices.  In conclusion, the patient was successfully treated and discharged after implantation of permanent cardiac pacemaker with adequate follow-up care advised."
