428.2,"Patient: [Name]  Gender: [Male/Female]  Age: [Age]  Diagnosis: Systolic heart failure, unspecified. The patient is suffering from congestive heart failure (CHF) with depressed cardiac function. The diagnosis is based on recorded symptoms and clinical findings consistent with systolic congestive heart failure (SCHF). Additionally, the patient has a history of cardiomyopathy, disordered cardiac function, and a past history of CAD (coronary artery disease).   Treatment: The patient was started on metoprolol for the management of CHF. The medication was gradually uptitrated to maximize the patient's cardiac function. The patient was also counselled on lifestyle changes including adhering to a low-sodium diet, daily exercise at least at a moderate rate, and avoiding stress triggers.   Outcome: The treatment regimens were followed for 10 days, and the patient showed complete resolution of symptoms. The ejection fraction (EF) recorded after the observation period was above 40%. The patient was discharged with prescriptions for metoprolol, application of BDU (Biventricular Defibrillator Unit), and appropriate counseling on lifestyle modifications. A follow-up appointment to be scheduled to monitor the patient's condition.   LeFort score of 40mph was given to the patient to help quantify the degree of congestive heart failure. However, with the treatment and management, the patient did not require admission to the intensive care unit.   Overall, the patient completed their hospital stay with a manageable discharge plan and the promise of ongoing care."
428.2,"Patient: [Name]  Age/Gender: [Age]/[Gender]  Medical Diagnosis: Systolic heart failure, unspecified  Summary:  The patient was admitted to the hospital with symptoms suggestive of congestive heart failure (CHF). A thorough evaluation was performed, which revealed cardiomyopathy and depression of left ventricular systolic function. Further evaluation showed no apparent cause for the cardiomyopathy, and the patient received a diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMP).  A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, which recorded an ejection fraction (EF) of 25% and systolic heart failure (SHF) with mild regurgitation. The patient was started on metoprolol to manage his heart failure, which he tolerated well.  Evaluation of the patient's past medical history revealed coronary artery disease (CAD) and a disordered sleep pattern (SCHF). Studies were also performed to determine the cause of the SHF, and the patient was found to have a low hemoglobin level, which was treated with iron.  The patient was discharged on medications for his heart failure, including metoprolol and budesonide (APPL BDUs), along with instructions for close follow-up with his cardiologist. The patient was advised to avoid strenuous activity, including any activity above 40mph.  At discharge, the patient's EF had improved to 35%, and he was doing well. He was advised to return to the hospital immediately if he experienced any worsening of his symptoms. Follow-up with his cardiologist was scheduled. The patient underwent a Lefort procedure and is currently recovering well."
428.2,"Discharge Summary:  The patient was admitted to our facility with a diagnosis of systolic heart failure (Schf), unspecified. The patient had a history of completed cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure (Chf). During the hospital stay, the patient was diagnosed with depressed Chf (Dchf) with an ejection fraction (Ef) of 40%, which indicated a severe form of Schf.  The patient was started on a regimen of metoprolol and other medications to manage the Chf, and the response was recorded. The patient's medical history revealed a previous coronary artery disease (Cad) diagnosis, which may have contributed to the Schf diagnosis.

The patient was monitored closely during the hospitalization, and disordered heart rhythms were recorded using a bedside monitor. The patient underwent a procedure to address the aortic valve regurgitation, and the patient's condition improved significantly. The patient was advised to follow up with the primary care physician and adhere to the prescribed treatment regimen.  Before discharge, the patient was educated about lifestyle changes and risk factors that can contribute to Schf. The patient was instructed to monitor daily activities and avoid strenuous exercise such as riding a bicycle at 40mph or performing other activities that could cause stress on the heart.  In summary, the patient was diagnosed with Schf and treated with metoprolol and other medications to manage the symptoms. The patient's response was recorded, and the patient underwent a procedure to address the aortic valve regurgitation. The patient was advised to follow up with the primary care physician and make lifestyle changes to manage the condition."

The patient had a depressed ejection fraction (EF) and was prescribed metoprolol to help manage their condition.  During the patient's hospital stay, diagnostic tests confirmed that they had CAD, which contributed to their worsened condition. The patient received appropriate treatment for this condition to improve their prognosis.  The patient had applied buprenorphine patches to help manage their chronic pain, and the medication was well-tolerated during their hospital stay.  The patient was also diagnosed with severe mitral regurgitation, which contributed to their congestive heart failure (CHF) symptoms. The patient's left ventricular systolic dysfunction was recorded, and appropriate treatment was given. The patient's CHF progressed to decompensated heart failure, leading to symptomatic cardiogenic shock (SCHF) requiring close monitoring and management.  The patient's condition was complicated by disordered breathing, as well as motor vehicle injuries due to an accident in which they were traveling at a speed of 40 mph. The patient was fortunate to escape with no significant injuries apart from a Lefort fracture.  The patient was discharged to a skilled nursing facility where they will receive continued care and management for their CHF, CAD, cardiomyopathy, and other related conditions.

428.2,"Patient Name: Unspecified Age: Unspecified Gender: Unspecified  Diagnosis: - Systolic Heart Failure (SchF) - Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) - Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) - Depression   Summary: The patient was admitted to the hospital with symptoms suggestive of congestive heart failure (CHF) and was diagnosed with SchF. The echocardiogram revealed DCM with an ejection fraction (EF) of 40%, which is indicative of a reduced pumping capacity of the heart. CAD was also discovered in the patient, which may have contributed to the development of SchF.   The patient's management included the administration of a beta-blocker, Metoprolol, with hospitalization in BDU. Additionally, appropriate lifestyle modifications were recommended, including a monitored diet, regular exercise, and the avoidance of strenuous activities such as running or cycling. Also, a regular follow-up with a cardiologist was advised.   The patient's depressive symptoms were also recorded, and counseling sessions were scheduled accordingly to address the issue.  During the hospitalization, the patient's condition improved, and he/she was medically stable on discharge. The patient was advised to continue taking Metoprolol regularly to manage SchF, adhere to dietary recommendations, and follow up with the specialist.  Reported incidents indicate mild mitral regurgitation as well as a disordered Lefort fractures likely unrelated to the patient's cardiac condition. As the patient's condition was relatively stable on leave, the readmission rate for SchF is expected to be low. However, the patient was reminded of the importance of timely management of symptoms and seeking help in case of any alarming signs.   The patient was discharged at a milder pace (40mph) with appropriate health education and instructions. The patient was advised to avoid long haul traveling or any activity that is physically demanding.

The patient was prescribed metoprolol to manage their symptoms. Additionally, it was noted that the patient had coronary artery disease (CAD) and aortic valve regurgitation (AVR).  During their hospital stay, the patient wore an Appl BDU device to continuously record their heart function. This revealed that the patient also had systolic congestive heart failure (SCHF).  Further diagnostic testing revealed that the patient's heart rhythms were disordered and did not respond well to pharmacological treatment. It was also noted that the patient's arterial blood gas levels indicated a possible increase in carbon dioxide levels. The patient was placed on 40mph continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and was also given lefort to help manage their symptoms.  Upon discharge, the patient was given instructions on how to manage their symptoms and was advised to follow up with their primary care provider.
