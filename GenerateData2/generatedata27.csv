Unfortunately, the patient ultimately expired due to multiple organ failure and subsequent cardiac arrest."
428.21,"Discharge Summary:  The patient was admitted to the hospital with systolic heart failure (CHF). The patient had a depressed cardiac output and was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy (CMP). During the hospital stay, the patient developed acute decompensated heart failure (DCHF) with fluid overload. Furosemide was administered and the patient responded well with the elimination of excess fluid. Metoprolol was also initiated to improve cardiac function.  The patient's echocardiogram identified significant mitral regurgitation and an ejection fraction (EF) of 25%, which indicated the patient's heart was not pumping efficiently. The patient presented with symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain on exertion.  After a thorough evaluation and treatment, the patient was discharged with improved cardiac function and the condition was stable. The patient received counseling on a heart-healthy diet, regular physical activity, and smoke cessation.  The patient will have to continue managing his/her congestive heart failure (CHF) condition and regularly follow-up with their physician to monitor for any worsening of their symptoms. In case of any deterioration, the patient is advised to come back to the hospital immediately.
