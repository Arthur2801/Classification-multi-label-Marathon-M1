423.9,"Discharge Summary:  The patient presented with a diagnosis of unspecified disease of pericardium with symptoms of chest pain, dyspnea, and fatigue. During their stay, the patient underwent a thorough evaluation, which included various imaging tests and lab work. The results of the tests showed the patient had pericarditis but no evidence of tuberculosis.  Further investigation revealed that the patient had completed pericardial cardiomyopathy, which is known to be a rare cause of pericarditis. A chest X-ray was done, which showed an effusion, and a diagnostic thoracentesis was performed, which confirmed a parapneumonic sarcoidosis diagnosis. This led to treatment with corticosteroids, which was continued throughout the patient's stay.  During the course of their care, the patient also developed hyperbilirubinemia, hepatitis physiology mediated by the sarcoidosis, and takotsubo cardiomyopathy. They were monitored closely for any signs of tamponade and responded well to the medical management.  After 7 days of inpatient admission, the patient was discharged home with a continuing course of corticosteroids and appropriate outpatient follow-up with their providers. The patient was advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle, dietary changes, and follow-up with their medical team for long-term health management.  Overall, the patient's hospital stay was complicated due to multiple diagnoses, and a thorough evaluation resulted in appropriate management of their disease processes."
423.9,"Patient: [Name]  Diagnosis: Unspecified disease of pericardium with completed pericarditis, pericardial cardiomyopathy, parapneumonic sarcoidosis, hyperbilirubinemia, takotsubo, hepatitis physiology mediated tuberculosis, tamponade, and effusion   Summary:  The patient, [Name], was admitted to the hospital with a complex presentation of pericardial disease. The initial diagnosis was unspecified disease of pericardium with pericarditis, pericardial effusion, and tamponade. The patient had a history of sarcoidosis and hepatitis, which complicated the diagnosis.  Further evaluation revealed a pericardial cardiomyopathy and hyperbilirubinemia. The patient was also found to have takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which is a rare condition that mimics the symptoms of a heart attack. The cause of the takotsubo was found to be mediated by tuberculosis, which is a known complication of tuberculous pericarditis.  The patient was treated with a combination of antibiotics, corticosteroids, and diuretics to address the different aspects of their condition. The patient responded well to treatment, and there was a resolution of the pericardial effusion and tamponade.  The patient was ultimately diagnosed with completed pericarditis with underlying pericardial cardiomyopathy and parapneumonic sarcoidosis, hyperbilirubinemia, takotsubo, hepatitis physiology mediated tuberculosis, tamponade, and effusion. They were discharged from the hospital with close monitoring and follow-up appointments with their primary care physician to ensure continued progress in their treatment."
