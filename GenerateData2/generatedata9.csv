After conducting a series of diagnostic tests, including an echocardiogram, we discovered that patient X had Tricuspid Seronegative Regurg Completed TR.  Tricuspid Seronegative Regurg is a rare condition that causes the heart's Tricuspid Valve to leak. Normally, the Tricuspid Valve prevents blood from flowing back into the heart, but in patients with Tricuspid Seronegative Regurg, this valve does not close properly, leading to a leakage of blood. This condition can cause symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and swelling in the legs and abdomen. In Patient X's case, his condition had progressed to Tricuspid Regurgitation, which required surgical intervention.  Patient X underwent successful surgery to repair the Tricuspid Valve, and our team continued to monitor his progress in the subsequent days with follow-up echocardiograms. During this time, we noted that he also had Pulmonary Regurgitation and a Patent Foramen Ovale, in addition to Hyperlipidemia, which was promptly treated with dietary changes and Metoprolol.  Pulmonary Regurgitation arises when the heart's Pulmonic Valve does not close properly, leading to a backflow of blood into the heart. A Patent Foramen Ovale is an opening in the heart that should close shortly after birth, but in some patients, may remain open, leading to abnormal circulation patterns.  Patient X also had Hyperlipidemia, commonly known as high cholesterol levels. The patient was counselled on the importance of a healthy diet and exercise regimen, as well as prescribed low doses of Metoprolol to regulate their heart rhythm.  After several days of monitoring and treatment, the patient was deemed stable enough to be discharged, and our team arranged for a follow-up appointment in two weeks' time. I recommended that he continues with prescribed medications and attends all scheduled follow-up appointments with a cardiac care specialist.  In summary, Patient X was diagnosed with Tricuspid Valve Disorders, Nonrheumatic, specifically Tricuspid Seronegative Regurg Completed TR, Pulmonary Regurgitation, Patent Foramen Ovale, and Hyperlipidemia. He underwent successful Tricuspid Valve repair surgery and was prescribed Metoprolol and a diet plan to treat Hyperlipidemia. We continue to monitor his progress and recommend regular follow-up visits to track his recovery."
424.2,"Patient Summary:  The patient, Mr. John Doe, a 56-year-old male, who presented with symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigue, was diagnosed with tricuspid valve disorder with tricuspid seronegative regurgitation completed TR and expired MV pulmonale regurgitation AR. The diagnosis was confirmed through echocardiography tests that showed moderate/severe regurgitation of tricuspid valves with features of pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, an atrial septal defect (ASD) or patent foramen ovale (PFO) and mild aortic regurgitation were noticed in the diagnostic tests.  Medical History:  Mr. Doe had a past medical history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was on metoprolol and albuterol inhaler for COPD. His family history was unremarkable for cardiovascular disease.  Hospital Course:  Once diagnosed with tricuspid valve disorder and other conditions, Mr. Doe was started on LeFort for a short period, with continued management of COPD symptoms. A follow-up echocardiogram was performed, where it was noted that the regurgitation of tricuspid valves remained moderate/severe with no significant changes in other outflow tract measures.  The patient was then evaluated by a cardiothoracic surgical team for valve repair or replacement, but it was determined that the risk of surgical intervention was too high due to significant comorbidities, particularly his pulmonary condition. Close monitoring was continued with lifestyle modifications and medication adjustments, including optimization of COPD treatment.  After several days of hospitalization, the patient's symptoms improved significantly. His dyspnea and fatigue resolved, and he was discharged with an improvement plan to follow up at a cardiology clinic. The plan included investigation of thromboembolism due to associated ASD/PFO and optimization of COPD management. Additionally, lifestyle modifications were recommended, such as a low-fat diet and regular exercise.  Conclusion:  In summary, the patient presented with tricuspid valve disorder and other comorbidities that rendered surgical intervention risky. The medical team managed his condition through medical intervention and lifestyle modifications, with satisfactory results. The patient was safely discharged from the hospital with well-placed plans for a follow-up appointment with his Cardiologist."
424.2,"Patient Information: The patient is a 52-year-old male, with a history of hyperlipidemia, who presented to the hospital with complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath.

424.2,"SUMMARY:  This is a discharge summary for a patient who was diagnosed with tricuspid seronegative regurgitation and completed tricuspid regurgitation. The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary regurgitation, atrial septal defect (ASD), hyperlipidemia, and mitral valve dysfunction. During the hospital stay, the patient was treated with metoprolol and lefort. This summary provides a detailed overview of the patient's diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.  BACKGROUND:  The patient was a 55-year-old male who presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and fatigue. The patient reported a history of heart disease and had a family history of coronary artery disease. The patient was initially evaluated through a physical examination, lab tests, and an echocardiogram. During the echocardiogram, the patient was diagnosed with tricuspid seronegative regurgitation and completed tricuspid regurgitation. The patient was also found to have pulmonary regurgitation, ASD, hyperlipidemia, and mitral valve dysfunction.  DIAGNOSIS:  The patient was diagnosed with tricuspid seronegative regurgitation and completed tricuspid regurgitation. Tricuspid regurgitation occurs when the tricuspid valve in the heart does not close properly, causing blood to flow backward into the right atrium. In addition, the patient was diagnosed with pulmonary regurgitation, which occurs when blood flows backward from the pulmonary artery into the right ventricle. The patient was found to have an ASD, which is a hole in the heart that allows oxygen-rich blood to flow from the left atrium to the right atrium. Additionally, the patient was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, which is an elevated level of fats in the blood. Lastly, mitral valve dysfunction was identified, which is a condition where the mitral valve in the heart doesn't work correctly, causing the blood to flow back into the left atrium.  TREATMENT:  During the hospital stay, the patient was treated with metoprolol, which is a medication used to treat hypertension and heart conditions. The patient was also treated with lefort, which is a surgical procedure used to repair or replace a damaged tricuspid valve. The patient was monitored closely, and regular echocardiograms were performed to assess his response to the treatment.  PROGNOSIS:  Overall, the patient's treatment was successful, and his condition improved during the hospital stay. The patient was discharged with a recommendation to continue taking his medications and follow-up with his primary care provider and cardiologist. The patient was also advised to make lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet, exercising, and quitting smoking. The patient's risk for complications is still present, but with careful monitoring and management, the patient can continue to lead a healthy and active life."
