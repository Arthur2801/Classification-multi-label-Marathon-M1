The patient has a history of congenital heart disease, including a birth defect known as Lefort procedure, permanent pacemaker (PPM) placement, and implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) placement. The implanted devices were placed due to complete heart block, right bundle branch block (RBBB), junctional rhythm, and atrial flutter (AFL).  Upon admission, the patient was found to have Other left bundle branch block (LBBB), which was different from the RBBB found during previous hospitalizations. The patient also had evidence of intermittent bradycardia (slowed heart rate) and atrioventricular block (AVB), which was thought to be related to the LBBB.  After completing various diagnostic tests, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram, the patient was found to have moderate biventricular hypertrophy (enlargement of both ventricles) and a low ejection fraction of 20%. The LBBB was found to be complete, meaning that both branches of the bundle were affected, which can cause delays in the electrical impulses that control the heart's rhythm.  Due to the patient's extensive cardiac history and the severity of the LBBB, the medical team decided to adjust the patient's medications and implant an upgraded ICD system to better monitor and treat the patient's cardiac conditions. Specifically, the ICD system was augmented with a special function known as biventricular pacing, which helps synchronize the heart's pumping actions by pacing both ventricles at the same time.  The patient made a steady recovery and was discharged with ongoing monitoring and management of the LBBB, RBBB, junctional rhythm, AVB, and AFL conditions. The patient was also advised to continue close follow-up with their cardiologist and maintain strict adherence to their prescribed medications and medical devices."
