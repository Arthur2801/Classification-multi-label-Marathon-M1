After reviewing Mr. X's medical history and conducting various diagnostic tests, the medical team concluded that Mr. X's condition had improved and that he was stable enough to be discharged from the hospital. He was advised to continue with his medications, a healthy diet, and regular exercise.  In conclusion, Mr. X was diagnosed with coronary atherosclerosis of an autologous biological bypass graft, but he underwent the necessary medical procedures, such as angioplasties and cardioversions, and was treated with different medications, including metoprolol, that contributed to his recovery. The medical team advised him to continue with his treatment plan and to follow a heart-healthy lifestyle to maintain his health."
414.02,"DISCHARGE SUMMARY:  The patient was diagnosed with coronary atherosclerosis of autologous biological bypass graft. The patient had undergone grafts completed through CABG (Coronary Artery Bypass Graft) and CABGx3 for 3V (Triple Vessel) disease in the past. The patient had also undergone several angioplasties and cardioversions to address CAD (Coronary Artery Disease) complications.  The patient's current condition was assessed based on their physiological symptoms and blood tests for metabolites. The results showed that the patient had sustained damage to the SVG (Saphenous Vein Graft), which was causing tachybrady, an abnormal heart rhythm. Further investigation confirmed that the patient had also developed coronary atherosclerosis in one of their biological bypass grafts.  To manage the patient's condition, the patient was prescribed a number of medications including metoprolol, which is commonly used to treat abnormally fast heart rhythms. The patient's overall management plan involved regular monitoring of their heart function, as well as lifestyle changes to aid in their recovery and prevent further complications.  In conclusion, the patient was discharged with a diagnosis of coronary atherosclerosis of autologous biological bypass graft. The patient is expected to adhere to their follow-up appointments and continue with their prescribed medications to manage their CAD and prevent further complications."
414.02,"This discharge summary is for a patient who was diagnosed with coronary atherosclerosis of autologous biological bypass graft. The patient underwent several medical procedures to manage the condition, including CABG, CABGx3, 3V metabolites SVG, angioplasties, cardioversions, and application of metoprolol.  The patient had multiple grafts completed, including CABG and CABGx3. The grafts utilized autologous biological bypass to address the coronary atherosclerosis that was present. The patient had three vessel disease (3V) which requires a more intensive treatment plan.  In addition to the grafts, the patient also underwent several other medical procedures to manage coronary atherosclerosis. The patient had SVG and angioplasties, which help to widen narrowed or obstructed arteries that lead to heart disease. Cardioversions were also performed, which are procedures that restore the heart's rhythm back to normal. These procedures were done to help improve the patient's heart function.  The patient also received medication to manage their heart condition. Metoprolol was prescribed to regulate the heart's rhythm and help to lower the risk of heart attack or stroke. This medication helps the heart to work more efficiently and decrease the patient's risk of developing complications related to heart disease.  Overall, the patient's condition was managed by a collaborative effort between the patient and their healthcare providers, including cardiologists, surgeons, and nurses. The improvement in the patient's condition was monitored, and they were discharged in a stable condition with instructions to continue their medications and have regular check-ups to monitor their health."
414.02,"CC: 71-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented to the hospital with chest pain and shortness of breath.  HPI: The patient reported experiencing chest pain for two days prior to admission, radiating to his left arm and associated with shortness of breath. Upon arrival, ECG showed evidence of atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Troponin levels were found to be elevated, prompting further evaluation of his CAD.  PMH: The patient underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) with autologous biological grafts in the past, in which three grafts were completed (CABGx3) due to three-vessel disease (3VD) and received three saphenous vein grafts (SVG). He also had a history of multiple angioplasties and cardioversions.  PE: On examination, the patient was alert and oriented. Heart sounds were regular, but tachycardic with intermittent bradycardia. Lungs were clear to auscultation. No peripheral edema was present.  DX: The patient was diagnosed with coronary atherosclerosis of autologous biological bypass graft with tachybrady syndrome.  TX: The patient was started on metoprolol to manage his tachybrady syndrome, and his medication regimen was adjusted to control his CAD symptoms. Further diagnostic testing revealed metabolites associated with graft failure, and a number of additional interventions were taken to prevent this, including catheterization and revascularization procedures as needed.  DISPO: The patient was discharged with instructions to follow up with his cardiologist, adhere to his medication regimen, and remain vigilant for symptoms of CAD recurrence."
