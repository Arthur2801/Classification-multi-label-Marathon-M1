A diagnosis of CHB was made, and the patient was started on DDD pacing.  During the hospitalization, the patient remained stable on DDD pacing, without any further episodes of tachycardia or dysrhythmias. The patient's rhythm was monitored throughout the hospitalization, and final testing confirmed that the patient no longer had any tachyarrhythmia or wct.  The patient was discharged in good condition, with close follow-up recommended. The patient was advised to continue taking medications and using the entrant PPM as directed. The patient was also advised to continue follow-up with the cardiologist to manage his condition and prevent any further relapses."
426,"Patient Name: [Name]  Age: [Age]  Diagnosis: - Atrioventricular block (AVB) - Complete heart block (CHB) - Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) - Tachyarrhythmia - Wide complex tachycardia (WCT) - Right bundle branch block (RBBB) - Trigeminy - Bigeminy - Primum atrial septal defect (ASD) - Interatrial block (entrant PPM)  Summary: The patient was admitted to the hospital with a history of dysrhythmia and palpitations. After a comprehensive workup, the patient was diagnosed with multiple cardiac conditions including AVB, CHB, and SSS. Additionally, the patient was noted to have WCT, RBBB, trigeminy, and bigeminy on ECG.  Further investigations revealed a primum ASD, which was likely contributing to the patient's dysrhythmia. An entrant PPM was subsequently inserted, which resolved the patient's AVB.  The patient was closely monitored for several days, during which no further dysrhythmia was identified. A DDD pacemaker was implanted with the aim of managing future episodes of tachycardia and bradycardia.  Overall, the patient's condition improved significantly, and the patient was discharged with instructions for regular follow-up with their cardiologist."
426,"Patient X was admitted to the hospital due to symptoms of tachyarrhythmia and completed heart block (CHB). Based on diagnostic testing, the patient was diagnosed with atrioventricular block (AVB) and sinus node dysfunction (SSS).  During their hospital stay, the patient underwent an electrophysiology study (EPS) which confirmed the presence of AVB and an atrial tachycardia with a wide complex tachycardia (WCT) and ventricular trigeminy. Due to the significant cardiac dysrhythmia, it was decided that a permanent pacemaker (PPM) with dual-chamber pacing (DDD) would be the best course of action for managing the patient's condition.  The implanted PPM was set to a rate-responsive mode with a lower rate limit of 60 bpm and an upper rate limit of 120 bpm in order to prevent episodes of tachycardia. The PPM also included entrant atrial overdrive pacing to reduce atrial dysrhythmia and trigger atrial capture. The device was successfully implanted without complications.  Follow-up monitoring indicated the patient had a right bundle branch block (RBBB) and evidence of both trigeminy and bigeminy. Notably, the patient exhibited a primum-type atrial septal defect, which contributed to their dysrhythmia.  The patient was discharged on medication management and advised to attend regular follow-up appointments with their healthcare provider to continue monitoring their condition."
426,"Patient X was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of atrioventricular block (AVB). This was confirmed by the presence of complete heart block (CHB) on electrocardiogram (ECG). The patient also had a history of tachyarrhythmia, with episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and wide-complex tachycardia (WCT) in the past.  Further investigations revealed that the patient had sinus node dysfunction with sinus bradycardia, supraventricular premature contractions (PACs), and atrial trigeminy on ECG. The patient also had a first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block with a prolonged PR interval, indicating an AV conduction delay.  A dual-chamber pacemaker (DDDR-PPM) was inserted to treat the AVB and associated dysrhythmias. The pacemaker was programmed to deliver atrial pacing to maintain sinus rhythm and prevent atrial entrainment. The device also had a sensing function to detect ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) and deliver appropriate therapy.  The patient's post-operative recovery was uneventful, and the pacemaker was successfully implanted without any complications. The patient was closely monitored for the next few days and had no further episodes of atrial trigeminy, bigeminy or other abnormal rhythms.  In conclusion, Patient X had a complex arrhythmia with multiple dysrhythmias, including AVB, CHB, tachyarrhythmias, and dysrhythmias. The patient was successfully treated with a dual-chamber pacemaker implant (DDDR-PPM) to maintain normal sinus rhythm and prevent further episodes of dysrhythmia. The patient was discharged from the hospital in stable condition with follow-up care to monitor the pacemaker."
426,"Patient: [Name] Diagnosis: Atrioventricular block (AVB), complete  Medical History: The patient presented with a history of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), completed atrial fibrillation (AF), and sick sinus syndrome (SSS). The patient had been implanted with a permanent pacemaker (PPM) with both atrial and ventricular leads in situ.  Clinical Course: Upon presentation, the patient had an electrocardiogram (ECG) that revealed complete AVB with a wide-complex tachyarrhythmia with aberrancy known as ventricular tachycardia (VT) with a right bundle branch block (RBBB) morphology. The patient also had frequent ventricular ectopic beats (VEBs) in trigeminy and bigeminy patterns. The patient was hemodynamically stable but required resuscitation with a synchronized cardioversion for the wide-complex tachycardia (WCT) with evidence of pre-excitation.  The patient was started on intravenous medications for rate control and converted to a narrow-complex sinus rhythm. Given the previous history of SVT, AF, and SSS, a dual-chamber pacemaker with dual-ventricular response and dual-atrial sensing capabilities (DDD) was recommended. The patient underwent successful placement of the pacemaker, which showed appropriate lead positions and sensing.  During follow-up, there was evidence of a primum atrial septal defect (ASD) with right to left shunting, which required further management. The patient also had dysrhythmia with episodes of re-entrant SVT, which were managed with ablation therapy.  Conclusion: The patient with complete AVB with a history of previous SVT, AF, and SSS underwent placement of a permanent pacemaker with dual-chamber and dual-ventricular response capabilities. The patient also had evidence of a primum ASD and dysrhythmia, which were managed with further therapy."
