Summary: The patient was diagnosed with acute and subacute bacterial endocarditis caused by a Streptococcus bovis bacteremia. The endocarditis had completed vegetation, with a large number of vegetations on the bicuspid and aortic valves. The patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics and metoprolol, which successfully controlled the infection and managed the patient's blood pressure. The patient responded well to the treatment, and the vegetations were eliminated. Follow-up echocardiography showed no residual particles or bacterial colonization. The patient was discharged after a 14-day hospitalization."
421,"Patient: [Insert name]  Diagnosis: Acute and subacute bacterial endocarditis  On initial presentation, the patient presented with symptoms of fever, fatigue, malaise, and joint pain. Blood cultures were drawn and confirmed the presence of bacteremia. Further evaluation with transesophageal echocardiography revealed the presence of multiple vegetations on the bicuspid aortic valve.  The patient was diagnosed with acute and subacute bacterial endocarditis. Empiric antibiotic therapy was started with intravenous vancomycin and gentamicin. Blood cultures eventually grew Streptococcus bovis and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The patient was switched to ceftriaxone and rifampin to target the bovis and MSSA, respectively.  Infectious disease consult was obtained, and long-term therapy with ceftriaxone was recommended for 6 weeks. The patient's fever and fatigue gradually improved over the course of the hospitalization. Repeat transesophageal echocardiography after completion of antibiotic therapy revealed that the endocarditis had completed resolved and there were no longer any vegetations present.  The patient was discharged on metoprolol for management of hypertension and advised to follow-up with cardiology for continued monitoring of their valves. The patient was also instructed to complete a full course of antibiotic therapy as an outpatient.  Overall, this was a severe illness with a large number of vegetations present, but prompt diagnosis and appropriate management with antibiotics led to a favorable outcome and resolution of the infection."
421,"Discharge Summary:  The patient was diagnosed with acute and subacute bacterial endocarditis caused by Streptococcus bovis. They completed a course of antibiotics and are currently stable. Vegetations were found on the patient's bicuspid aortic valve, which required surgical intervention. Bacteremia was also noted, which further intensified the illness. The patient was put on metoprolol to manage their symptoms.  The team was able to successfully treat the patient's endocarditis, and no new vegetations were observed during their stay. The number of particles in the patient's blood also decreased significantly. Treatment for MSSA bacteremia was provided, and the patient responded well to the medication.  At discharge, the patient was instructed to continue taking antibiotics and to schedule follow-up appointments with their cardiologist. They were advised to monitor their health closely and report any symptoms or concerns to their healthcare provider."
421,"Patient Name: [REDACTED] Age: Unknown Gender: Unknown  Diagnosis: Acute and subacute bacterial endocarditis caused by Streptococcus bovis and Methicillin-Susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA)  History: The patient was admitted to the hospital with complaints of fatigue, fever, and shortness of breath. Medical history revealed a bicuspid aortic valve, which was replaced with a mechanical valve five years ago.  Findings: Blood cultures were positive for S. bovis and MSSA, indicating bacteremia. An echocardiogram revealed vegetations on the prosthetic valve. A transesophageal echocardiogram was completed to get a clearer picture of the particle number and size of vegetations.  Treatment: The patient received intravenous antibiotics for six weeks. Oral metoprolol was prescribed to improve heart function and reduce the risk of further damage. There was no need for surgery in this case, as the antibiotics were able to successfully treat the infection.  Outcome: The patient recovered without complications and was discharged after completing the course of antibiotics. A follow-up appointment was scheduled with the cardiologist to evaluate the state of the vegetation and monitor the patient's overall health."
