427.41,"Patient X was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of ventricular fibrillation (VF), a serious cardiac arrhythmia characterized by irregular and rapid contractions of the heart muscles. The patient had a history of ventricular tachycardia (VTach), premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and fibrillatory waves on electrocardiogram (ECG). The patient also suffered from mitral valve regurgitation, a condition that can lead to blood backflow into the heart.   Upon initial evaluation, the patient was found to be in asystole, a state of cardiac arrest characterized by a lack of electrical activity in the heart. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed, and after 2 minutes of resuscitation, the patient's heart spontaneously converted to non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), a heart rhythm that is characterized by periods of rapid contractions followed by periods of normal rhythm.   Despite the administration of multiple treatments, including defibrillation, the patient's irregular heart rhythm persisted, and the patient was diagnosed with ventricular fibrillation. The patient's doctors decided to perform a maze surgery, a procedure that involves creating scars in the heart tissue to alter the heart's electrical pathways in an effort to treat the arrhythmia.   Following the surgery, the patient's heart rhythm improved, but the patient still experienced episodes of fibrillation, and the patient was diagnosed with fibrillatory torsades. Despite maximum medical management, the patient's condition deteriorated rapidly, and the patient ultimately expired after completing the next  few minutes."
