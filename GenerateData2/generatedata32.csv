428.3,"Patient: 44-year-old male with a diagnosis of diastolic heart failure (DCHF) and hyperlipidemia.  History: The patient has a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, asthma, and disordered sleep. He presented to the hospital with symptoms of shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the lower extremities.  Physical Exam: On physical examination, the patient was noted to have mild pulmonary edema, elevated jugular venous pressure, and a grade 2/6 systolic murmur consistent with aortic regurgitation.  Diagnosis: The patient was diagnosed with DCHF and unspecified systolic heart failure (SCHF). An echocardiogram showed diastolic dysfunction with a preserved ejection fraction. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) was also noted.  Treatment: The patient was started on a treatment plan that included diuretics and beta-blockers. He received furosemide (Lasix) and metoprolol. Hyperlipidemia was also managed with appropriate therapy. The patient's condition improved, and he completed treatment.  Outcome: At the time of discharge, the patient's condition was stable, and he was found to be appropriate for discharge. Unfortunately, the patient eloped from the hospital before his care could be completed. Follow-up with the patient was not possible after discharge due to elopement.   Conclusion: In summary, a 44-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and disordered sleep was diagnosed with DCHF and unspecified SCHF. Treatment with Lasix and metoprolol was administered, and the patient's condition improved although he eloped before completing his care. The patient's hyperlipidemia was also managed appropriately."
428.3,"Discharge Summary:  The patient, a 44-year-old male, was diagnosed with Diastolic heart failure, unspecified (DCHF) during his recent hospitalization. He had a history of hyperlipidemia and disordered pulmonary function. The patient completed his course of medication for DCHF during his hospital stay, including metoprolol and lasix, as prescribed by the treating doctors.  The patient eloped from the hospital against medical advice before further testing could be conducted to specify the type of DCHF he was suffering from. Upon discharge, the patient was given a prescription for furosemide and advised to follow up with his primary care physician for further evaluation and treatment of his condition.  Additionally, the patient was diagnosed with mitral valve regurgitation and left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary pulmonary hypertension of uncertain etiology. An echocardiogram was done, which showed evidence of mild systolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, and pulmonary hypertension. SCHF was ruled out during this hospitalization.  A written discharge summary was provided to the patient with instructions on self-care and referral to a local heart failure clinic. The patient was advised to monitor symptoms such as shortness of breath and swelling in the legs, and to report any such symptoms to his healthcare provider immediately. It is hoped that the patient will follow through with the recommended treatment plan and that his condition will improve over time."
