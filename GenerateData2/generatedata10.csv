425.1,"Patient Mr. X has been diagnosed with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). HOCM is a genetic cardiac condition, resulting from the thickening of the heart muscle (hypertrophy), usually of the left ventricle, leading to obstruction of the outflow tract or LVOT. Mr. X was symptomatic with exertional dyspnea, chest discomfort, and a sudden fainting episode. On examination, he had a hyperdynamic precordium, mid-systolic ejection murmur, and mitral valve prolapse (MVP).  Initial investigations included a 2D-echocardiogram showing a hypertrophied interventricular septum and LVOT obstruction, with a resting gradient of 80 mmHg, which increased with exercise. Also, there was systolic anterior motion (SAM) of mitral valve with MVP. Coronary angiography revealed no significant stenosis, confirming the diagnosis of HOCM.  The patient was treated with a beta-blocker, verapamil, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He was started on oxygen therapy and bronchodilators due to underlying bronchopulmonary disease (HTXN) and hypercapnic respiratory failure. However, he developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAFib) and required oral anticoagulants like ocps, and rhythm control therapy. LVF and right heart failure (RHF) were prevented with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and loop diuretics.  The patient was monitored for arrhythmias and withdrew from exertion, sports. He was counseled about HOCM related sudden death and recommended family screening. Regular follow-up with additional testing, including stress testing and echocardiography, was advised.  In summary, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is a genetic condition characterized by hypertrophy of the heart muscle leading to obstruction, dysrhythmia, and abnormal function.

425.1,"Patient Name: [Redacted] Diagnosis: hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM)  Summary: [Redacted] is a [age]-year-old patient who was recently diagnosed with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). HOCM is a condition where the heart muscle (myocardium) becomes thicker than normal, leading to hypertrophy. This thickening can affect the heart's ability to fill with blood and pump it out, often resulting in heart failure.   In [Redacted] case, HOCM has led to left ventricular hypertrophy, producing an obstructive component that causes his symptoms. Further, the patient is also suffering from mitral valve prolapse, a condition where the valve between his left atrium and ventricle does not function properly, resulting in blood leaks.  Due to the thickening of his heart muscle, [Redacted] heart has become hyperdynamic, which puts him at risk of developing dysrhythmias. In fact, he experienced paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAFib), an irregular and often rapid heartbeat that can lead to blood clots, heart stroke, and other heart complications.   The patient also manifests rhf, which means right heart failure. This is often caused by pulmonary hypertension when the right ventricle of the heart has to work harder than normal to pump blood to the lungs.   To manage his condition, [Redacted] is being treated with medications, including OCPs (oral contraceptives), which can help regulate his heart's rhythm. Still, given the complexity of his case and the severity of his symptoms, the patient has been scheduled for elective surgical correction through a myectomy, the planned treatment for his obstructive component.  In summary, [Redacted] has been diagnosed with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) accompanied by mitral valve prolapse, hyperdynamic heart, PAFib, and RHf. The management strategy for him includes the use of medication and elective surgical correction. So far, his treatment seems to be completed, and he is expected to make significant improvements."

425.1,"Patient discharge summary:  The patient has been diagnosed with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), a condition characterized by hypertrophy or thickening of the heart muscle. Despite receiving treatment, the patient's HOCM has progressed resulting in an enlarged heart (hypertrophy), and hyperdynamic function leading to a mitral valve prolapse. The patient has also developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), which is a type of irregular heartbeat, leading to dysrhythmias and left ventricular failure (LVF).  The patient underwent a series of tests that included pulmonary function tests, echocardiography, and cardiac catheterization. The completed tests showed that the patient's hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has progressed to include pulmonary hypertension, and may have potentially caused right heart failure (RHF). There were also some reports of the patient experiencing paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that is frequent but of brief durations, likely due to their current state of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. They have been prescribed some oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) to help with the condition's symptoms and to regulate their menstrual cycles.  The patient's condition is considered irreversible at this point, as therapies such as surgery couldn't meet the required efficacy standards. It is essential that the patient's cardiologist closely monitor their left ventricular function, and timely therapeutic options be determined that maintain or improve such function.  The patient will require continuous care to manage their condition. Proper medication must be administered at the appropriate times, and patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy must avoid intense physical activity to minimize the risks of further complications. The patient must immediately report any episodes of chest pain, arrhythmia, or difficulty breathing."
