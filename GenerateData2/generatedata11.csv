411.89,"Discharge Summary:  The patient was admitted with a condition of Other acute and subacute forms of ischemic heart disease. On examination, we observed the presence of demand ischemia indicated by depressed ST-segment elevations in a few leads. We promptly performed ECG and completed troponins test for the detection of biomarkers of infarction. The troponin Trop number showed marked elevations indicating acute cardiac injury.  Further, echocardiography was conducted, which confirmed the presence of hypokinesis and depressed wall motion in the left ventricle of the heart. Considering these findings, the patient was diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and was managed with appropriate interventions.  During the hospital stay, the patient was closely monitored, and troponin levels were recorded regularly. We assessed the patients' response to therapy, which showed a reduction in troponin levels, indicating the recovery of cardiac function.  However, despite the best efforts of the medical team, the patient's condition deteriorated, and sadly, the patient expired due to complications of the disease.   To summarize, the patient was diagnosed with Other acute and subacute forms of ischemic heart disease, with evidence of demand ischemia, biomarkers, depressions, hypokinesis, and depressed wall motion.

411.89,"Discharge Summary:  The patient was admitted to the hospital with complaints of chest pain and was diagnosed with Other acute and subacute forms of ischemic heart disease. The patient underwent further investigations, including blood tests and echocardiography.  The blood tests revealed elevated levels of troponin, a biomarker commonly used to diagnose myocardial infarction. The patient's troponin levels were in the completed trop number, suggesting a heart attack had already occurred.  The echocardiography showed hypokinesis and depressions in the heart muscle, indicating that the patient's heart function was compromised. The evaluation of the patient's medical history also revealed that they had a previous episode of heart disease.  Due to the patient's ACS condition, they were treated with medication and advised to adopt a healthier lifestyle. However, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate, and despite the best medical efforts, the patient expired.

411.89,"This is the discharge summary of a patient diagnosed with other acute and subacute forms of ischemic heart disease. The patient was admitted to the hospital due to complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath.  Upon admission, the patient was evaluated for possible ischemic heart disease. The results of the ECG showed ST-segment depressions in the precordial leads, and initial troponin levels were elevated. As a result, the patient was started on anticoagulation therapy and statins.  Further evaluation revealed hypokinesis in the inferior and lateral walls of the left ventricle with associated regional wall motion abnormalities. A stress test was performed which was positive for demand ischemia.  Cardiac catheterization was then performed, which revealed severe three-vessel coronary artery disease. During the procedure, the patient experienced an acute myocardial infarction necessitating balloon angioplasty and stenting of the culprit vessel.  Troponins were repeated, and completed, showing further elevations. Other biomarkers were negative for non-cardiac events. In light of the patient's recent acs condition, medications were titrated to optimal doses, and further monitoring of their cardiac condition was scheduled.  The patient was discharged with a diagnosis of other acute and subacute forms of ischemic heart disease. They were advised to adhere closely to their prescribed medications and to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Unfortunately, the patient expired later due to prolonged cardiac arrest."
411.89,"Discharge Summary:  The patient was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of Other acute and subacute forms of ischemic heart disease. The initial evaluation revealed evidence of demand ischemia and Ischemic completed troponins (troponin trop number) biomarkers that indicated myocardial infarction. The patient also displayed depressions and hypokinesis in the EKG results, which further confirmed the diagnosis.  The treatment involved immediate medical intervention, which included antiplatelet and thrombolytic medications. The patient was monitored closely throughout their hospital stay, and troponin levels were measured regularly. The recorded levels showed initial depressions with subsequent elevations, which indicated a high-risk ACS condition.  During the course of hospitalization, the patient showed signs of improvement, and ischemic EKG changes subsided. However, they also continued to exhibit depressed hypokinesis and elevated troponin levels, leading to an increased risk for recurrent ischemia.  Unfortunately, the patient's condition expired suddenly due to cardiac arrest. Despite medical interventions, the patient succumbed to the complications of their ischemic heart disease. Their family was notified of the unfortunate outcome, and arrangements were made for the final rites to be performed."
411.89,"Mr. X, a 60-year-old male, was admitted to our hospital complaining of chest pain that had been ongoing for the past week. Testing revealed evidence of demand ischemia as well as ischemic depressions, which was indicative of his underlying condition of Other acute and subacute forms of ischemic heart disease. Troponin levels were initially elevated at 0.12 ng/mL, which was concerning for myocardial infarction.  Further evaluation confirmed the presence of LV hypokinesis, with global wall motion being depressed. His condition warranted the use of completed troponins as part of his ongoing cardiac biomarkers monitoring. Over the course of the next few days, his troponin levels peaked at 2.3 ng/mL, which was highly concerning for ACS.  Despite aggressive medical management, Mr. X's clinical status continued to decline, with persistent elevations in troponin levels indicative of ongoing myocardial damage. Unfortunately, his clinical condition ultimately expired after several attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful.

The patient reported no significant medical or surgical history but did report a family history of heart disease.  Physical Examination: Upon physical examination, there were no abnormal findings. The patient's vital signs were within normal limits. A 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST segment depressions in lead V1 to V6, indicative of ischemia. Troponin levels were drawn upon admission, and the initial troponin T was elevated at 0.48 ng/mL (normal < 0.04 ng/mL). Serial troponins were drawn every 6 hours and peaked at 2.10 ng/mL.  Treatment: The patient was started on a heparin drip and scheduled for a cardiac catheterization to further evaluate and treat the condition. The cardiac catheterization revealed significant blockage in the left anterior descending artery resulting in a completed infarction. Left ventricular hypokinesis was noted with an ejection fraction of 30%. The patient was diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and treated with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.  Outcome: The patient recovered well from the CABG surgery, however, the recovery phase was complicated by demand ischemia as evidenced by new ST depressions on the ECG and worsening troponin levels.

411.89,"Discharge Summary  The patient was diagnosed with other acute and subacute forms of ischemic heart disease, which was confirmed through the use of multiple biomarkers such as completed troponin tests, and trop number readings. These biomarkers revealed raised levels of troponins and elevations in the patient's biomarker readings indicating acute cardiac injury. There was evidence of ischemia (demand ischemia) causing hypokinesis of the myocardium (a contracting part of the heart) and resulted in ST-segment depressions indicating an abnormality of the heart's electrical function.
