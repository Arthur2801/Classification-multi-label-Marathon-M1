396.3,"DISCHARGE SUMMARY  Patient: [insert name here]  Diagnosis: Mitral Valve Insufficiency and Aortic Valve Insufficiency  The patient was admitted to our hospital facility for evaluation of chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations. Upon admission, the patient was thoroughly assessed and diagnosed with Mitral Valve Insufficiency and Aortic Valve Insufficiency based on the following findings:  - Ar - Aortic Regurgitation (also known as Aortic Valve Insufficiency) - Regurge – Regurgitation (also present in both valves) - Insufficiency – which refers to the incomplete closure of the mitral and aortic valves, allowing blood to flow back into the chambers of the heart instead of flowing forward  Based on our diagnostic procedures, we have determined the causes of the patient's condition. The Mitral Valve Insufficiency is secondary to mitral valve prolapse (MVP), which ultimately caused the valve to become loose and unable to close tightly. Meanwhile, Aortic Valve Insufficiency is due to valvular Regurgitation, where there is a leakage of blood from the aorta during the diastolic period of the cardiac cycle.  The patient also has a history of CAD (Coronary Artery Disease) and chronic MR (mitral regurgitation). Given these underlying conditions, we suspect that they have contributed to the development of the current disease.  During their stay in our facility, the patient received medication to help manage their symptoms, which included diuretics, vasodilators, and antiarrhythmic agents. Assessment revealed that their symptoms improved, and the patient was deemed stable enough to be discharged.  The patient was advised to undergo follow-up evaluations and management for his mitral valve insufficiency, aortic valve insufficiency, and underlying conditions. If the management of such diseases fails, surgical interventions such as an AVR (Aortic Valve Replacement), a Mitral Valve Replacement, or other necessary interventions may be considered.  Finally, it was recommended that the patient undergo lifestyle changes, which included maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, and refraining from cigarette smoking. Continued follow-up and compliance with medical interventions can help prevent complications, lower the risk of associated morbidity or mortality, and improve the patient's overall quality of life.  Additional findings include LAE (Left atrial enlargement), which signifies an increase in the size of the left atrium, likely caused by a longstanding systolic dysfunction. The presence of other findings was not noted after the appropriate diagnosis of Mitral Valve Insufficiency and Aortic Valve Insufficiency.  In summary, the patient was diagnosed with Mitral Valve Insufficiency and Aortic Valve Insufficiency secondary to MVP and valvular regurgitation. Further management and follow-up are needed to ensure the wellbeing of the patient."
396.3,"DISCHARGE SUMMARY:  Patient Name: [Redacted]  Diagnosis: - Mitral Valve Insufficiency (MV) - Aortic Valve Insufficiency (AI)  Medical History: The patient was diagnosed with valvular insufficiency, in which the mitral valve and aortic valve are affected. The mitral valve insufficiency (MV) occurs when the valve between the left atrium and the left ventricle of the heart does not close properly, causing backflow or regurgitation of blood back to the atrium. On the other hand, aortic valve insufficiency (AI) is when the valve between the left ventricle and aorta of the heart does not close properly, causing blood to leak back or regurgitate into the left ventricle.  Treatment: The patient was prescribed medications to help manage the condition, such as ACE inhibitors and diuretics. In addition, the patient was instructed to maintain a low-sodium diet and to avoid any strenuous activities or heavy lifting that may exacerbate the condition. The medical team also recommended regular cardiac check-ups to monitor the conditions.  Prognosis: The prognosis for this patient is difficult to predict as it depends on the severity of the mitral and aortic valvular regurgitation.

396.3,"Discharge Summary:  This discharge summary pertains to a patient who was diagnosed with both mitral valve insufficiency and aortic valve insufficiency during their hospital stay. The patient was admitted with complaints of shortness of breath, chest pain, and palpitations, which led to the diagnosis of valve insufficiency.  Upon evaluation, it was determined that the patient's mitral valve (MV) had a regurgitation (regurge) of moderate to severe degree, which was causing symptoms due to the backflow of blood into the left atrium (LAE). The patient's aortic valve (AV) was also found to have moderate to severe amount of regurgitaion (regurge), which was leading to an increase in the workload on the heart (AVR).  Mitral valve insufficiency (MI) is a condition that occurs when the valve between the left atrium and left ventricle of the heart fails to close properly, thereby allowing backflow of blood into the LAE. This condition can be caused due to various reasons, including structural damage to the valve, degenerative changes, or infection. In this case, it was due to structural damage caused by age-related degenerative changes.  Aortic valve insufficiency (AI) occurs when the valve between the left ventricle and aorta fails to close properly, leading to backflow of blood into the left ventricle and increasing the pumping workload of the heart. This condition can be caused due to various reasons, including congenital defects, infection, or age-related wear and tear. In this case, it was due to age-related degenerative changes.  The patient was treated with medications to reduce the workload on the heart and improve the function of the valves. In addition, the patient was advised to make lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking and eating a healthy diet to minimize the risk of further damage to the valves. The patient was also prescribed anticoagulants to prevent blood clots from forming around the damaged valves.  The patient was advised to follow up with their primary care physician and cardiologist regularly to monitor their condition and adjust the treatment plan as needed. It is important for the patient to understand that despite treatment, valve insufficiency is a chronic condition that requires lifelong monitoring and management to prevent complications.  In conclusion, this patient was diagnosed with mitral valve insufficiency and aortic valve insufficiency, which were managed with a combination of medications, lifestyle changes, and regular monitoring. The patient was advised to follow up with their healthcare providers regularly to ensure optimal management of their condition."

The team discussed possible surgical intervention, including mitral and aortic valve replacement (AVR).  During the hospitalization, the patient was noted to have left atrial enlargement (LAE), which further supported the presence of significant valvular disease.  The patient was discharged with close follow-up with cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery teams. The plan is to continue medical therapy and reevaluate for surgical intervention at a later time. The patient was instructed to monitor for signs and symptoms of worsening heart failure and to seek prompt medical attention if they develop."
