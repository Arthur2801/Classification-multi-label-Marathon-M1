428.31,"Patient Name: _________________ Discharge Date: ________________  Discharge Summary:  The patient was admitted to the hospital due to an acute exacerbation of diastolic heart failure, which resulted in increased overload and fluid retention leading to congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient had a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease, which may have contributed to this condition.  The patient was evaluated by our cardiac services and a complete workup was performed, including echocardiogram and laboratory analysis. These tests confirmed the diagnosis of diastolic heart failure with evidence of regurgitation, which was found to be partially contributing to the patient's symptoms. The identified condition was treated with diuresis therapy which consisted of furosemide (Lasix) and Metoprolol, which help in reducing blood pressure and easing the overload.  During hospitalization, the patient was placed on Metoprolol to treat the underlying condition. Also, furosemide (Lasix) was initiated and gradually increased according to daily laboratory and clinical evaluations, leading to diuresis and a notable decrease in fluid overload. The appropriate dosage was maintained, taking caution not to cause electrolyte imbalance.  Following the treatment protocol, the patient completed their course of diuretics and was evaluated for discharge eligibility. Their clinical improvement, including the resolution of fluid overload, was noted. With proper medication, this discharged patient was stable, and the discharge plan included instructions on timely follow-up with their physician regarding any disordered conditions.   The patient expired after their discharge, and no further records are available.  Final Diagnosis: Diastolic heart failure with regurgitation, causing acute exacerbation leading to congestive heart failure (CHF).  Treatment Protocol: 1.

Physical examination revealed signs of pulmonary congestion and jugular venous distension.  History: The patient has a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient had previously been diagnosed with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) with reduced ejection fraction six months ago.  Clinical Course: During hospitalization, the patient was diagnosed with Diastolic Heart Failure (DHF) with evidence of diastolic dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy on an echocardiogram. The patient was initially started on diuretics (Furosemide/Lasix), and a regimen of lisinopril, aspirin, and metoprolol were added. The patient's fluid overload improved as diuresis completed. The patient was closely monitored for any signs of volume and electrolyte abnormalities.  During the hospital stay, the patient developed acute CHF with symptoms of pulmonary overload and diuretic resistance. There was an associated mitral regurgitation with an increase in the number of PVCs. Appropriate changes in medications were made, and diuresis was assisted using intravenous Bumetanide and spironolactone for management of Schizophrenia (SCHF).  Despite the medical interventions, the patient's condition remained disordered, and the patient expired.  Discharge Diagnosis: 1. Diastolic Heart Failure (DHF), Acute 2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), Acute 3. Mitral Regurgitation 4. Schizophrenia (SCHF)  Recommendations: The patient was diagnosed with Diastolic Heart Failure (DHF), Acute and was managed with medications and diuretics which resulted in diuresis. However, despite the interventions, the patient's symptoms were exacerbated and led to acute CHF with concomitant mitral regurgitation. The patient expired while still in the hospital due to poor response to treatment.  In conclusion, the patient had a complex medical history that included multiple comorbidities.
