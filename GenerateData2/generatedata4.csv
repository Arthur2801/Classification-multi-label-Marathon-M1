429.9,"Patient Summary:  The patient, Mr. John Smith, is a 56-year-old male who was admitted to our hospital with a complaint of chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Upon further evaluation, he was diagnosed with Heart disease, unspecified, likely due to his job strain and lifestyle habits.  Diagnostic Procedures:  Several diagnostic tests were performed, including an echocardiogram which revealed significant diastolic dysfunction and hypokinesis in the LV, consistent with a possible cardiac overload. This was further confirmed with a cardiac catheterization, which showed a number of obstructions in the coronary arteries along with a possible cardioembolic source. During the catherization, gadolinium was used to illuminate the areas of the heart being examined.  Treatment Plan:  The patient was immediately started on anticoagulant therapy to prevent emboli and embolism formation, as he had a history of DVTs. These clots can be potentially catastrophic if they travel up to the heart and cause an embolus. Further therapy included medication for heart failure along with tight control of his blood pressure to reduce strain on the cardiac system.  Follow-Up:  The patient was monitored closely during his hospital stay and was successfully treated with medication and lifestyle modifications like smoking cessation and a balanced diet. He was discharged with instructions to continue his medications, follow up with his primary care doctor, and to maintain his progress towards improved cardiovascular health.  Conclusion:  Mr. Smith presented to our facility with Heart disease, unspecified, likely due to his lifestyle choices and job strain. We were able to confirm the diagnosis with several diagnostic procedures, including catherization, and begin him on a treatment plan to reduce his risk of embolism formation and overload on his cardiac system. With continued support, we anticipate he will improve his cardiac function and lead a healthier life."

429.9,"Discharge Summary:  This discharge summary pertains to a patient named John Doe who was admitted to our facility with a diagnosis of Heart Disease, Unspecified. As the attending cardiologist, I closely monitored and treated the patient in collaboration with the healthcare team throughout his stay.  Upon admission, the patient complained of chest pain and shortness of breath. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment depressions in some leads, and laboratory tests revealed elevated levels of Troponin, indicating a myocardial infarction. Further imaging studies were performed, which included echocardiography and cardiac MRI. The echocardiogram revealed diastolic dysfunction, hypokinesis of the left ventricular wall (HK), and an ejection fraction of 45%. The MRI confirmed findings of HK and showed a small area of subendocardial scar in the anterior wall of the left ventricle.  The patient had a history of job strain and had been under considerable emotional stress prior to admission. He also had a history of hypertension and high cholesterol levels. Given these factors, he was diagnosed with cardioembolic heart disease, which was further confirmed by a gadolinium-enhanced cardiac MRI. As a result, anticoagulation therapy was initiated to minimize the risk of emboli formation and embolism.  A coronary catherization was performed which revealed a 60% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery, which was then stented. Additionally, the patient was found to have a number of deep vein thromboses (DVTs) in his lower extremities. The patient was started on anticoagulation therapy and an inferior vena cava filter was placed to prevent any emboli from reaching his pulmonary arteries causing a pulmonary embolism (PE).  During the course of his admission, the patient developed fluid overload secondary to his heart disease and was treated with diuretics. He also developed an embolus that was found to be from one of the DVTs in his lower extremity. The patient was monitored closely until the embolus could be dissolved.  At the time of discharge, the patient's symptoms had improved, and he was stable on medications. He was provided with lifestyle modification recommendations, including dietary changes, increased physical activity, and stress reduction techniques.

He presented with exertional dyspnea, chest discomfort, and syncope episodes twice in the past month.  Hospital Course: Upon admission, the patient underwent a detailed cardiac evaluation, which included an electrocardiogram (ECG), chest X-ray, echocardiography, and stress tests. The ECG showed sinus tachycardia with ST-segment depression in leads V2-V6. The chest X-ray was unremarkable. The echocardiography showed diastolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the left ventricle, which was confirmed on a cardiac MRI with gadolinium enhancement. The stress test was positive for ischemic changes, which prompted a coronary angiogram that showed no significant obstructive coronary artery disease.  The patient also underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), which showed a small patent foramen ovale (PFO) and a left atrial appendage thrombus. The patient was started on anticoagulation therapy with heparin and transitioned to warfarin. The patient was also diagnosed with a cardioembolic component, and further evaluation with a hypercoagulability workup was negative.  Discussion: The patient's heart disease is characterized by diastolic dysfunction, which is a condition where the heart's pumping function is impaired during the filling phase of the cardiac cycle. This condition is common in patients with hypertension and older age. The patient's job strain as a postal worker may have contributed to the development of hypertension and diastolic dysfunction.  The patient also had a cardioembolic component, which is a type of heart disease that results from blood clots forming in the heart and traveling to the lungs or brain, causing pulmonary embolism (PE) or stroke. In this case, the patient had a left atrial appendage thrombus, which was effectively treated with anticoagulation therapy.  Conclusion: The patient was discharged with a stable condition on anticoagulation therapy with Warfarin. He was advised on lifestyle modifications, including regular exercise, a low-salt diet, and smoking cessation. The patient was also instructed to follow up with his primary care physician and cardiologist regularly to monitor his condition. The patient was advised to report any new symptoms or adverse events to his healthcare providers immediately.

Doe is a 51-year-old Caucasian male who presented with chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient was experiencing intermittent chest pain for several months, but it became more severe in the past week. The patient also reported shortness of breath with mild exertion. No previous cardiac history was reported. The patient's medical history was significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia.   Physical Examination:  On admission, the patient's vital signs were stable. The physical examination revealed bibasilar crackles and no peripheral edema. Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rhythm, normal heart sounds, no murmurs or rubs. There were no clinical signs of heart failure.   Diagnostic Evaluation:  The patient's initial tests showed an elevated troponin level (0.5 ng/mL). An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, but no ST-segment elevation or depression. An echocardiogram showed evidence of diastolic dysfunction, with grade II diastolic dysfunction and hypokinesis of the left ventricle. Cardiac catherization was performed, which revealed minimal coronary artery disease. However, a cardioembolic source was suspected. Gadolidium-enhanced MRI of the brain was ordered for further evaluation, which showed no abnormalities. Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities showed bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) without evidence of emboli.   Hospital Course:  The patient was started on anticoagulant therapy for the DVTs and was continued on aspirin and cholesterol-lowering therapy. He was started on a beta-blocker for symptomatic relief of chest pain and shortness of breath. Over the course of the next several days, the patient's symptoms improved significantly.   Discussion:  Job strain has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease, which may be a contributing factor to this patient's heart disease. The diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction and cardioembolic source in this patient is consistent with heart disease, resulting in overload of the left atrium and ventricle with potential risks of emboli formation. This is further supported by this patient's diagnosis of bilateral DVTs. The hypokinesis identified in the patient's LV is suggestive of myocardial scar tissue, and additional imaging is necessary to rule out a previous coronary artery embolus (embolism).

Assessment: The patient underwent an extensive evaluation including electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and cardiac catheterization, which revealed significant diastolic dysfunction with hypokinesis in the heart's left ventricle. There were no significant coronary artery blockages detected on Catheterization. However, the patient's gadolinium-enhanced MRI revealed areas of cardiomyopathy due to overload of her heart muscle, which could be caused by hypertension, genetic predisposition, or frequent emotional stress related to her job exposure.   Management: The patient's management primarily included decreasing the risk of cardioembolic complications and deep vein thrombosis (DVTs). She was started on anticoagulants to reduce the possibility of future Embolism. Additionally, the patient was prescribed medications to lower blood pressure and improve cardiac function. The extent of overload in the heart muscle needed further evaluation, and patient was scheduled for further follow-up tests for measuring workload and ability to work. Aggressive management of any lifestyle changes such as diet alterations, exercise, and the reduction of job-related stress, that perhaps would be crucial in reducing future complications in the patient.  Prognosis: The patient presents with significant diastolic dysfunction, which could progress to heart failure, stroke or even a pulmonary embolus (PE). However, with excellent medication management, rehabilitation, and stress reduction programming, there is a reasonable chance of stabilizing the patient and reducing future cardiac events while improving her functional status. The long-term outlook will depend heavily on her ability to make significant lifestyle alterations that will reduce her cardiac stress and continue adherence to prescribed anti-coagulant therapy. The care of the patient will continue with consultation for further investigation of underlying causes of her heart components on Cardiac MRI."
