Imaging studies revealed an infarct indicating an acute myocardial infarction (MI).  Further workup revealed an underlying three vessel coronary artery disease (3VCAD) and myocardial disease. The patient was stabilized on medication including metoprolol to slow the heart rate and manage hypertension. The patient's condition improved gradually to the point that he was able to be discharged and closely followed up for management.  However, the patient was subsequently readmitted for another episode of care for an acute MI (AMI) on top of the underlying myocardial disease. This illness was monitored carefully, and further testing like an echocardiogram was done to check for any arrhythmic tendencies. Troponin (tnt) levels were watched closely and escalated in tandem with the progression of the disease, indicating an impending MI. The patient was closely monitored, and a timeline was established to ensure quick intervention before complications set in.  Unfortunately, despite the best care, the patient's condition continued to worsen, ultimately leading to the patient's unexpected expiration.  The findings of this case highlight the significance of timely interventions in the context of acute myocardial infarctions, particularly where there is underlying cardiac pathology. Attention should be paid to early identification of such conditions to enable early and accurate management to avoid fatal outcomes as evidenced here."
