Certify:  I certify that I was involved in the care of this patient and the information provided is accurate based on my best knowledge and understanding.  Physiology: Acute pericarditis is an inflammation of the pericardium (sac-like structure enclosing the heart). In certain cases, it leads to pericardial effusion - liquid accumulation in the pericardial cavity, putting pressure on the surrounding organs in the heart. Tamponade refers to the critical progression of pericardial effusion, leading to cardiovascular collapse. A maze procedure is a type of heart surgery that aims to restore regular heart rhythm, usually conducted on atrial fibrillation patients. Vegetations are nodules built by a deposit of microbes inside the tissue or valves of heart. Pericardiocentesis is the relieving approach of a pericardial effusion by insertion of a needle into the pericardium under ECHO or Fluoro guidance.

420.9,"Subject: Discharge summary for patient diagnosed with Acute pericarditis, unspecified  Dear Doctor,  I am writing to provide a discharge summary for a patient who was diagnosed with Acute pericarditis, unspecified, during their recent hospital admission. The patient, a 50-year-old male, was admitted to our cardiac unit after complaining of chest pain and shortness of breath.  Upon examination, the patient displayed classic signs of pericarditis, including chest pain worsened by deep breaths, a rasping or grating sound during auscultation, and an enlarged heart. An echocardiogram showed an increased thickness of the pericardium and the presence of mild pericardial tamponade.  The patient underwent a maze procedure, where radiofrequency energy was used to create areas of scar tissue in the heart to block abnormal electrical impulses that cause arrhythmia. The operation was successful, but the patient had to remain in bed rest for three days due to complications resulting from the procedure.  Additionally, the patient exhibited vegetations and strains in the heart muscles, which further complicated the diagnosis. An episode of gastroenteritis also occurred during the hospital stay which impacted the patient's physiology.  The medical team prescribed medication to manage the patient's symptoms, including tamponade relief and vasovagal medications. They also monitored the condition using a cardiac monitor, and the patient was closely watched to ensure he did not experience an episode of AVRT (atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia) or GIST (gastrointestinal stromal tumor).  Despite these complications, the patient made a full recovery and was discharged after receiving certification from our medical team. We recommended the patient to maintain a healthy lifestyle, avoid stressors, and adhere to prescribed medications to prevent the recurrence of pericarditis.  Thank you for placing your trust in our team to care for your patient.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]"

Ventricular arrhythmia 3. Pericardial tamponade 4. Gastroenteritis  HISTORY:  The patient, a XX-year-old male with no significant medical history, presented to the hospital with chest pain and shortness of breath. Upon admission, the patient's ECG showed ST-segment elevation indicative of pericarditis. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a small pericardial effusion with no signs of tamponade physiology. The patient was started on Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for symptomatic relief.  HOSPITAL COURSE: During the patient's hospitalization, he complained of diarrhea and abdominal pain, which was determined to be caused by gastroenteritis. Additionally, the patient developed a ventricular arrhythmia, and a subsequent 24-hour Holter monitor showed frequent ventricular ectopy, which was treated with amiodarone.   A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed due to the patient's persistent chest pain, and new onset shortness of breath and hypotension, which revealed the presence of a large pericardial effusion with signs of tamponade physiology. Emergent pericardiocentesis was performed, and approximately 500 ml of clear, yellow fluid was drained from the pericardial space.  Laboratory evaluation of the pericardial fluid showed no evidence of bacterial, fungal, or viral organisms. Pathological examination of the pericardial tissue demonstrated the presence of vegetation consistent with acute pericarditis caused by a possible vasovagal response to a recent change in the patient's medication.  The patient was started on antibiotics and underwent a maze procedure to treat the arrhythmia. Electrophysiological study demonstrated AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVRT), which was treated with radiofrequency catheter ablation.   The patient remained stable throughout the hospitalization and was certified for discharge upon successful removal of his pericardial drain.  DISCHARGE PLAN: The patient was discharged on an outpatient basis with instructions to continue amiodarone and NSAIDs, with follow-up visits to his gastroenterologist and cardiologist scheduled.
